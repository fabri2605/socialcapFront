We have one Root contract, which contains the roots of all data sets:
```
  @state(Field) communitiesRoot = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) personsRoot = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) membersRoot = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) claimsRoot = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) tasksRoot = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) credentialsRoot = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) votingsRoot = State<Field>(); 

  @method updateCommunity(
    org: ProvableCommunity,
    map: MerkleMapProxy,
    witness: MerkleMapWitness,
    updated: MerkleMapUpdate
  ) {
  // and similar methods for each data set ...  
```

No problems with this part.

And we have a ClaimContract related to the voting process: 
```
class Votes extends Struct({
  total: Field,
  positive: Field,
  negative: Field,
  ignored: Field
}){}

class EndConditions extends Struct({
  votes: Field, // if we have at least the votes election is finished
  positives: Field // if we have this positive votes claim is approved
}) {}

class VoteAction extends Struct({
  isValid: Bool,
  positive: Bool,
  negative: Bool,
  ignore: Bool,
}) {}

class NullifierProxy extends Struct({
  root: Field,
  witness: MerkleMapWitness
}) {
  static key(electorUid: Field, claimUid: Field): Field {
    return Poseidon.hash([electorUid, claimUid])
  } 
}

// Voting states for an Elector on this Claim
const 
  NOT_ASSIGNED = Field(0),
  PENDING = Field(1),
  VOTED = Field(2);


export class ClaimContract extends SmartContract {
  // events to update Nullifier
  events = {
    'nullify-voter': Field,
    'updated-voting-status': Field
  };

  // the "reducer" field describes a type of action that we can dispatch, and reduce later
  reducer = Reducer({ actionType: VoteAction });

  // Account states
  @state(Field) claimUid = State<Field>(); 
  
  @state(Field) votes = State<Field>(); 
  // THIS FIELD IS NOT REALLY NEEDED AS CAN BE COMPUTED AS SUM FROM OTHER VOTES
  // SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH 'applicantUid' 

  // Votes 
  @state(Field) positive = State<Field>(); 
  @state(Field) negative = State<Field>(); 
  @state(Field) ignored = State<Field>(); 
  // WOULD BE GOOD IF WE CAN PACK THIS INTO JUST ONE FIELD
  // SO WE COULD ALSO HAVE THE REQUIRED VOTING END CONDITIONS
  // required votes 
  // required positives

  // Final result 0: Not finished, 1: Approved, 2: Rejected
  @state(Field) result = State<Field>(); 

  // A nullifier with used to avoid double voting and disable voting from not assigned electors
  // key=hash([electorUid,claimUid]) and value= 0 | 1 | 2 (the voting state)
  // NOT SURE IF THIS NEEDS TO BE HERE OR WE CAN HAVE IT IN THE ROOT CONTRACT
  @state(Field) nullifierRoot = State<Field>(); 

  // helper field to store the point in the action history that our on-chain state is at
  @state(Field) actionsState = State<Field>(); 
  
  //@state(EndConditions) required = State<EndConditions>(); // 2

The ClaimContract compiles and deploys but has not been tested yet.

Questions:

1) Every time an Applicant makes a new Claim, we will create a new account for that Claim, so each claim will have its own public state on-chain (voting results and final state). Also the accountId will be also an inmutable record for that claim. 
From what I understand we need:

- to redeploy and initialize the ClaimContract but with another set of keys
- and this will become the new account.

I think this is correct, but would like your confirmation

2) As can be seen in the code the 'sendVote()' does not change the state, it just dispatchs an action which will be processed by a reducer. We will have a central server which will be calling the 'rollupVotes' reducer whenever new votes arrive until a claim is finished.

This has the problem that we will need to have many open zkApps (one per each open claim) running in this server when dealing with many claims at the same time. And will need to have a queue of open zkApps so we can call rollup on each one, or open each aone as needed. Something like:

```
  PSEUDOCODE HERE :-)
  for each claim in queue
    let instance = new ClaimContract(claim.address);
    const txn = await Mina.transaction(() => {
        instance.rollupVote(claim.endConditions);
      }
    );
    await txn.prove();
    await txn.sign().send();
```

The fee payer will be our main account and not any users account.  

Question: what problems do you see here, is it feasible (not performant, but just feasible) ?
